# Ball Me, Blazor.
[.NET Core 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) is approaching release and with it comes a ton of new features to make the platform even more production ready. Today's topic of focus is the UI framework [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/client).

## What's a Blazor?
Blazor is included in [ASP.NET Core](https://asp.net), starting with version 3.0, which is in preview as I write this post. Blazor is a new UI framework that can be run on the client (browser) or server. Blazor functions like most single page application (SPA) frameworks, and allows you to build your application almost entirely using C# and the .NET APIs you are already familiar with. Running Blazor on the client is where the real magic happens. This flavor of magic is a combination [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/).

### The Magic: Web Assembly
The first ingredient to the magic sauce is Web Assembly.
>WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. [(Source: WebAssembly.org)](https://webassembly.org/)

So Web Assembly is basically a virtual machine that can run binary instructions inside the browser. You might think you've heard of this kind of techology before, Ã  la Adobe Shockwave, or maybe Microsoft Silverlight. If you're familiar with those technologies you'll know that they both got their five minutes of fame before being quickly replace by the next big thing. 

#### So, what's different this time?
Web Assembly isn't a plugin. It's a new standard that is implemented directly in the browser. If you're wondering how long it will be until modern browsers start supporting Web Assembly, the answer is _yesterday_. Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple's Safari, and Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Edge all support Web Assembly, including their mobile versions!

Web Assembly runs in the same security space as JavaScript, so similar restrictions and functinality are observed. Web Assembly can even access the JavaScript interpreter to gain access to additional functionality, and reuse some existing JavaScript code. It's also able to access some features of HTML, such as geolocation, through JavaScript.

### The Magic: Mono
Mono is a community built opensource implementation of the .NET Framework. It can be used to build cross platform applications on desktop as well as mobile. [Recently the Mono community was able to port their compiler to run on Web Assembly.](https://www.mono-project.com/news/2018/01/16/mono-static-webassembly-compilation/) Which, being compatible with .NET Standard APIs, allows .NET Applications to be compiled and then executed on the browser.

### Back to Blazics.
Using these two powerful platforms Blazor allows you to create Web UI applications that run entirely on the browser and allow you to write all of the code in C#. 

If you don't want to run your application in the browser for any number of reasons: SEO, performance, portability, etc, then you can run your Blazor application on the server side as well. You can have an ASP.NET application server your Blazor application as regular HTML. All of the applications events are then sent over the wire using [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/real-time) and processed on the server. Any state changes are then sent back to the client, and the DOM updates. This will allow for better SEO and faster initial loading times, but you may fall victim to increased latency as every event must be sent back and forth fromt the server.
